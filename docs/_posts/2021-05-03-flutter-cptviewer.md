### CPTViewer

Welcome to my first Flutter application called CPTViewer. This application will load GEFCPT files and show the charts for the CPT.

**Note** your uploaded files will not be saved on the server!

More information on GEFCPT files can be found [here](https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/display/STREAM/GEF-CPT)

Scroll down to find the actual link to the app.

### Manual

I like my apps to be simple and effective so it should be easy but here goes;

![manual](https://github.com/breinbaas/breinbaas.github.io/blob/master/img/cptviewer.02.png?raw=true)

The implemented soiltype correlations are;

* no correlation
* three type rule (a big thanks to [Mattijs Borst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattijsborst/) for sending his code)
* CUR162 based on electrical cone

### Bugs / ideas?

If you get an error it will (hopefully ;-) be shown as a message on the bottom of the screen like;
![manual](https://github.com/breinbaas/breinbaas.github.io/blob/master/img/cptviewer.04.png?raw=true)

You've got 5 seconds to make a screenshot ;-) and send it to me. Be sure to add the used GEF file for debugging or else I cannot
debug the code. 

Check the current issues and add new issues to [the issue tracker](https://github.com/breinbaas/cptviewer_issues/issues)

### The app

The app can be found at the following URL [https://cptviewer-458db.web.app/#/](https://cptviewer-458db.web.app/#/)

### Support my work

If you use my apps why not support me by hiring me for a course 'Python for engineers' or development work or a simple donation and make sure that these apps will stay free and online. I still have to pay server costs and my development time isn't free either. You can contact me using breinbaasnl@gmail.com, Thanks, Rob!
