### CPTViewer

Welcome to my first Flutter application called CPTViewer. This application will load GEFCPT files and show the charts for the CPT.

**Note** your uploaded files will not be saved on the server!

### Support my work

If you use my apps why not support me by hiring me for a course 'Python for engineers' or development work or a simple donation and make sure that these apps will stay free and online. I still have to pay server costs and my development time isn't free either. You can contact me using breinbaasnl@gmail.com
