### Pyproj and Postgres installation pains

So you want to install pyproj and postgres.. enter a world of pain.. well it might.

If you are working on Windows it is best to install pyproj from the [precompiled packages repository](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyproj) That will make live a little easier or even super easy. But if you have Postgres installed you might run into trouble running pyproj in a Python script and you might get an error like this;

```ERROR 1: PROJ: proj_identify: D:\Apps\PostgreSQL\12\share\contrib\postgis-3.2\proj\proj.db contains DATABASE.LAYOUT.VERSION.MINOR = 0 whereas a number >= 2 is expected. It comes from another PROJ installation.```

This can be quite annoying but it simply means that your Python pyproj is not pointing towards / using the pyproj database that came with the pyproj package. And that is because Postgres also installed its own version of pyproj. Postgres probably also setup the path to PROJ_LIB and this will point to the Postgres proj library.

Note that QGis installs the PROJ database in 

```<whereeveryouputyourapps>\PostgreSQL\12\share\contrib\postgis-3.2\proj``` 

and Python will install it in 

```<whereeveryouinstallyourpythonenvs>\.env\Lib\site-packages\pyproj\proj_dir\share\proj```

I found two useful workaround;

* simply change the path PROJ_LIB in your windows settings while running the script (and don't forget to reset it after using the script)
* change the PROJ_LIB environment variable in the script that you use (this will not override the windows path setting)

That's all, I hope it helps if you ever run into this problem like I did.

Cheers,
